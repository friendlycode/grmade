<p>If you're a designer or developer, I could use your help. For example, I know my jQuery could definitely be better, and I'm not much of a designer, so I've shared the Illustrator files of the logo. You can <a href="https://github.com/pichot/grmade.org">check out the code and design files on GitHub</a>. Have at it!</p>

<p>I'm building this site in my free time, so any help, even if it comes in design or development suggestions, would be greatly appreciated! You can <a href="http://about.me/pichot">get a hold of me here, one way or the other</a>.</p>
